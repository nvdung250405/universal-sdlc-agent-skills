# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

- System: [SYSTEM_NAME]
- Document ID/version/status: [ID] / [VERSION] / Draft
- Owner / reviewers: [..]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
### 1.2 Scope and goals
### 1.3 Definitions, acronyms and glossary
### 1.4 References
### 1.5 Document overview

## 2. System context
### 2.1 Business context and objectives
### 2.2 Stakeholders and user classes
### 2.3 Operating environment
### 2.4 System boundaries and external systems
### 2.5 Assumptions, dependencies and constraints

## 3. Functional requirements
Group by capability/domain. Every requirement has a stable ID, one testable obligation, priority, rationale/source and verification method.

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Rationale/source | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-AREA-001 | The system MUST ... | Must | [..] | [test/inspection/analysis/demo] |

## 4. External interface requirements
### 4.1 User interfaces
### 4.2 Software/API interfaces
### 4.3 Hardware/device interfaces (if applicable)
### 4.4 Communications, events and protocols

## 5. Data requirements
- Domain entities and relationships:
- Data ownership and source of truth:
- Data quality, validation and uniqueness:
- Retention, deletion, archival and export:
- Migration and compatibility:

## 6. Non-functional requirements
Express targets quantitatively where practical; identify the verification method and operating conditions.

| ID | Attribute | Requirement/target | Conditions | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-PERF-001 | Performance | p95 latency <= [target] | [load, environment] | [load test/telemetry] |
| NFR-SEC-001 | Security | [control/outcome] | [threat context] | [review/test/tool] |

Consider reliability, availability, performance, scalability, accessibility/usability, maintainability, interoperability, portability, observability, privacy, safety and compliance as applicable.

## 7. Business rules and state transitions

## 8. Error handling and operational requirements
- Error categories, user-visible behavior, retry/idempotency, audit events, support signals.

## 9. Acceptance and verification strategy
- Requirement verification approach:
- Required test levels:
- Test data/environment constraints:
- Definition of acceptance:

## 10. Traceability and change management
- Stable IDs are never recycled; removed requirements are marked Retired/Deprecated.
- Every requirement maps to design, implementation slice, and verification evidence in `docs/rtm.md`.
- Proposed changes identify affected IDs and downstream artifacts.
