# Production incident response workflow

Use this workflow for active production or staging incidents affecting service stability, customer experience, data integrity, or security. Follow organizational incident policies and severity definitions when established.

---

## 1. Stabilize & Coordinate
1. **Assess Symptoms & Scope**: Inspect incoming alerts, error rates, p95/p99 latency spikes, affected user segments, and recent deployments.
2. **Assign Incident Commander**: Establish a single operational lead and communication channel (`#war-room`). State provisional severity:
   - `SEV-1 (Critical)`: Full customer outage, critical data corruption, or active security exploit.
   - `SEV-2 (Major)`: High error rate or degraded performance on core revenue/business paths.
   - `SEV-3 (Minor)`: Isolated non-critical failure with available workaround.
3. **Check Service Runbook**: Follow triage instructions in `docs/runbooks/[service-name].md` (from `templates/runbook.md`).
4. **Prioritize Mitigation Over Root Cause**: Restore user service immediately before deep investigation:
   - Revert recent deploy: Roll back to last-known-good version.
   - Shift traffic: Reroute traffic away from unhealthy instances or regions.
   - Throttle / Circuit break: Shed non-critical traffic or disable degraded features via feature flags.
5. **Preserve Evidence**: Snapshot logs, container states, and metrics. Never paste secrets, credentials, or customer PII into incident notes.

## 2. Diagnose & Resolve Root Cause
6. **Telemetry Deep-Dive**: Once service is restored or stabilized, use `observability-and-instrumentation` and `service-mesh-observability` to correlate traces, error spikes, and database pool saturation.
7. **Isolate in Non-Production**: Use `systematic-debugging` to reproduce the failure in staging or a local reproduction environment. Do not perform high-risk exploratory experiments directly on production.
8. **Develop Smallest Surgical Fix**: Write a regression test proving the failure, implement the fix with `test-driven-development`, and verify against production-equivalent volume/edge conditions.

## 3. Postmortem, Action Items & Prevention
9. **Author Blameless Postmortem**: Scaffold and publish `docs/incidents/[YYYYMMDD-slug]/postmortem.md` (from `templates/incident-postmortem.md`) within 48 hours:
   - Summary and customer impact (duration, % requests affected).
   - Detailed timeline in UTC.
   - Root cause analysis using 5 Whys.
   - What went well vs. where response was delayed or fortunate.
10. **Track Preventative Action Items**: Convert preventative measures (index additions, alert threshold tuning, pipeline gates, circuit breakers) into concrete backlog tickets with designated owners and target completion dates.
11. **Update Runbooks & Alerts**: Ensure `docs/runbooks/[service-name].md` and alert thresholds are updated to catch or auto-mitigate similar failure modes in the future.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not declare an incident resolved solely because an alert cleared. Confirm end-user traffic and core SLIs/SLOs have normalized within the target operating envelope for at least 15 minutes.
