name: task-handoff
description: Create and maintain a task file that carries goal, decisions, failed attempts and next steps so work survives context limits and passes cleanly between roles, sessions or different agents. Use when starting any multi-step task, when context is getting long, when switching agent or role, or when resuming earlier work.

# Task handoff

A task file is the single shared memory between roles, sessions and agents.

## Start
1. Copy `assets/task-template.md` to `.agent/tasks/<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>.md`.
2. Fill Goal, Scope, Acceptance criteria, Links (spec, ADRs). Leave other sections for later.

## While working
Append, do not rewrite. After each meaningful step add a dated line under **Log**:
- decisions and the reason,
- approaches tried that failed, and why,
- open questions or blockers.

## Hand off
Before stopping or switching role/agent, update **Next step** so a fresh agent with no memory can continue. State: current status, exact next action, files touched, commands to verify.

## Resume
Read the task file first, then only the files it points to. Do not re-derive decisions already logged. If the log contradicts the code, trust the code and note the discrepancy.

## Rules
- Pass paths between roles, not pasted content.
- Never put secrets in the task file.
- One task file per task; link related tasks.

Done when a different agent could continue using only this file and the repo.
