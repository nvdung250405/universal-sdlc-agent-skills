# Feature development loop

Use for implementing a feature in an existing codebase. Read existing repository context and guidance first. Do not fork a second artifact system.

---

## 1. Specification & Quality Gate
1. Identify feature scope and canonical spec path: `docs/features/<feature-id>/spec.md` (scaffold from `templates/feature-spec.md` if not present).
2. If product intent is unsettled, consult or update `docs/prd.md` with `pm-product-spec`.
3. Use `pm-user-story` to add/refine user-facing stories and Given/When/Then Acceptance Criteria directly inside `docs/features/<feature-id>/spec.md`. For purely technical changes, use a technical spec or ADR instead of fabricating stories.
4. Run `pm-spec-quality-audit` if the specification is complex, ambiguous, or needs a pre-build quality gate.

## 2. Contract-First Architecture & Design Seams
5. Follow **Contract-First** design: establish observable interfaces and boundaries before internal persistence implementation:
   - **Interface & Wire Contracts (Contract-First):** Use `api-and-interface-design` and `api-contract-testing` to define REST/gRPC/GraphQL schemas, request/response models, and compatibility fixtures before modifying persistence layers.
   - **Persistence & Migration (Persistence Second):** Once interface contracts are defined, invoke `database-design` to design normalized tables, indexing strategy, and zero-downtime database migrations required to satisfy the contract.
   - **Component Boundaries & Models:** Use `software-architecture` when feature logic alters module seams, C4 diagrams, or domain ownership.
   - **Design Trade-offs:** Use `documentation-and-adrs` to record meaningful architectural decisions in `docs/adr/ADR-NNN-[slug].md` (from `templates/ADR.md`).
   - **Security & Threat Surface:** Use `threat-model-analyst` and `security-and-hardening` if the feature crosses trust boundaries, handles credentials, or processes sensitive data.
   - **UI Styling & Tokens:** Use `frontend-design` and `frontend-ui-engineering` for design tokens and layout composition.

## 3. Planning & Task Breakdown
6. Use `planning-and-task-breakdown` as the **sole author** of the final `docs/features/<feature-id>/tasks.md` (from `templates/tasks.md`). Every task must specify target file paths, dependencies, acceptance conditions, and exact verification commands.

## 4. Construction & TDD Loop
7. Implement in thin, verifiable slices using `incremental-implementation`.
8. Write tests before code with `test-driven-development` where behavioral tests can drive the implementation. Ground unfamiliar APIs with `source-driven-development`.
9. For unexpected test failures or regressions, invoke `systematic-debugging`: reproduce, isolate root cause, state hypothesis, and add regression guard.

## 5. Review, Verification & Acceptance
10. Run relevant unit, integration, contract, and browser tests (`webapp-testing` or `browser-testing-with-devtools`).
11. Conduct code review using `code-review-and-quality`; prepare PR description using `templates/pull-request.md`.
12. Execute `verification-before-completion` to record fresh empirical evidence in `docs/features/<feature-id>/acceptance-report.md` (from `templates/acceptance-report.md`).
13. Update session handoff log in `.agent/tasks/<task-id>.md` using `task-handoff`.

> [!NOTE]
> If implementation uncovers an unexpected architecture, data migration, or security risk larger than initially estimated, pause and route back to the owning design/spec stage before continuing.
